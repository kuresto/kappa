Just another framework for lambda functions


I just wanna a simple enough lambda framework...



## Roadmap for now

- Need to process at least the API Gateway event
- Need to add an intuitive Request and Response Schema (Something like FastAPI would be nice)
- I want a nice way to transform exceptions to responses
- YES I WANT API GATEWAY FIRST
- Some testing helpers would be nice

## Future

- Deploy?
- Check for Method Request?
- Multiple handlers = Multiple functions
- Multiple handlers = Single function, many endpoints

## Nice2Have

- Cloudwatch events
- Some other events
